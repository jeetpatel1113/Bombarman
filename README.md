Bombarman is a multiplayer game that combines classic arcade action with networking capabilities, allowing players to compete in a destructive arena. The goal is to strategically place bombs to destroy blocks and eliminate opponents.

The project is developed in Python and uses Pygame for graphics and sockets for network communication. It's a great example of a simple but engaging multiplayer game built from the ground up.
